The recent cultivation of the strain HBSQ001 and thesequencing of its genome allows comparison with the metagenome of this taxonomically simplified environment. Similar studies carried out in other extreme environments have revealed very little diversity in gene content among the cell lineages present.In this work we isolated biomass from a saltern crystallizer with the aim of retrieving mostly \"H. walsbyi\"- related material, and compared the recovered gene diversity with that of the sequenced strain's genome, isolated specifically from this same pond two years earlier [17]. The results of this study, which involved end-sequencing of ca. 2000 fosmid clones suggest that \"H. walsbyi\" shares a large accessory gene pool that could easily exceed the size of the sequenced strain's genome.",
