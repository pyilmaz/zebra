Following the method of Wardlaw and Valentine, pore water was extracted from one-half of the sediment by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 15 min) and filtered through a 0.2-\u00b5m filter. The remaining sediment was stored at -80\u00b0C for subsequent molecular analyses. Sediment from a second core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, placed in acid-washed (20% HCl), precombusted (450\u00b0C, 4 h) glass vials, and stored at -20\u00b0C prior to analysis of bulk sediment chemical properties.",
