            "study_abstract": "The vertebrate gut microbiota evolved in an environment typified by periodic fluctuations in nutrient availability, yet little is known about its responses to host feeding and fasting. As many model species (for example, mice) are adapted to lifestyles of frequent small meals, we turned to the Burmese python, a sit-and-wait foraging snake that consumes large prey at long intervals (>1 month), to examine the effects of a dynamic nutrient milieu on the gut microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities harvested from the intestines of fasted and digesting snakes, and from their rodent meal. In this unprecedented survey of a reptilian host, we found that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes numerically dominated the python gut. In the large intestine, fasting was associated with increased abundances of the genera Bacteroides, Rikenella, Synergistes and Akkermansia, and with reduced overall diversity. A marked postprandial shift in bacterial community configuration occurred. Between 12_h and 3 days after feeding, Firmicutes, including the taxa Clostridium, Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae, gradually outnumbered the fasting-dominant Bacteroidetes, and overall ''species''-level diversity increased significantly. Most lineages seemed to be indigenous to the python rather than ingested with the meal, but a dietary source of Lactobacillus could not be ruled out. Thus, the observed large-scale alterations of the gut microbiota that accompany the Burmese python''s own dramatic physiological and morphological changes during feeding and fasting emphasize the need to consider both microbial and host cellular responses to nutrient flux. The Burmese python may provide a unique model for dissecting these interrelationships.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed.

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

Following death, a mid-ventral incision was made to expose the gastrointestinal tract, which was removed. The contents of the cecum and the proximal and distal regions of the small and large intestines were emptied into sterile vials, immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at &#8722;80&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",

The gut content mass was determined by weighing the organ before and after emptying. In fasted snakes, the small intestine contains a small amount of clear fluid, presumably secretions from the gall bladder, pancreas and intestine. Here, several milliliters of sterile saline were used to flush the fasted small-intestinal contents into collection vials. After feeding and before day 10, the small intestine contained enough material to be squeezed directly out into vials. The large intestine typically contains some material, including residual feces, fluid and urate originating from the kidneys in fasted snakes. In the present study, material from the meal started entering the large intestine ~1-day postfeeding, with the cecum filling at 2 days. At day 3 and beyond, the large intestine and cecum were fairly filled with the material.",
