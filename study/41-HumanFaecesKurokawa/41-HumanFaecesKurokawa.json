They form a complex microbial community that deeply affects human physiology. To identify the genomic features common to all human gut microbiomes as well as those variable among them, we performed a large-scale comparative metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from 13 healthy individuals of various ages, including unweaned infants. All the subjects were healthy Japanese individuals. All subjects or their parents were informed of the purpose and protocol of this study. None of the subjects were given dietary restrictions except for antibiotics, probiotics, fermented foods (fermented beans, yogurt, etc.), and well-known functional foods for at least 4 weeks prior to sampling. None had a history of gastrointestinal disorder at the time of sampling, and none had unusual eating behaviors.",

Three grams of wet fecal sample were suspended vigorously in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.",

The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing.

The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.",

The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon).

The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing.

Three grams of wet fecal sample were suspended vigorously in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.",

Three grams of wet fecal sample were suspended vigorously in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mM Na2HPO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). The suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh nylon filter (Falcon). The bacterial cells in the filtrates were collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, suspended in 10 ml of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), and then used for DNA isolation. The lysis of bacterial cells was carried out under almost the same conditions as those described in the literature.26Go In brief, 1.5 mg of lysozyme was added to 10 ml of cell suspension. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing, 2 mg of proteinase K were added and the mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. Subsequently, 1.2 ml of 10% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate was added to the cell suspension, which was further incubated at 55\u00b0C for 1 h with gentle mixing. High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, RNase A treatment, ethanol, and finally polyethyleneglycol precipitation.",
