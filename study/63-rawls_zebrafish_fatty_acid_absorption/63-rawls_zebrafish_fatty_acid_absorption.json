            "study_abstract": "The intestinal microbiota is known to impact host nutrition and energy balance. However, its role in dietary fat absorption in the intestine is unclear. Here, we use in vivo imaging of fluorescent fatty acid (FA) analogs delivered into gnotobiotic zebrafish to reveal that the microbiota stimulates FA uptake and lipid droplet (LD) formation in the intestinal epithelium. Comparison of animals that were starved or fed a sterile diet reveals that the microbiota promotes epithelial LD number, but not size, in a diet-dependent manner. The presence of food results in Firmicutes enrichment in the microbiota of the zebrafish intestine, but not in the surrounding water. Monoassociation studies reveal that LD number is increased by diet-enriched Firmicutes and LD size is increased by other bacterial types. These results indicate that members of the gut microbiota regulate intestinal FA absorption via distinct mechanisms and that diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota membership might indirectly influence FA absorption.",
