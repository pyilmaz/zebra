We used shotgun sequencing of microbial community DNA and targeted sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to gain an understanding of how microbial communities adapt to extremes of diets. We sampled fecal DNAs from 33 mammalian species and 18 humans who kept detailed diet records, and found that the functional adaptation of the microbiota to diet is similar across different mammalian lineages. The differences between microbiomes of host species having different diets appears to stem from differing abundances of shared functions, for example the microbiomes of carnivores have specialized to degrade proteins as an energy source, while communities within herbivores have specialized to synthesize amino acid building blocks.  These results illustrate the value of characterizing vertebrate gut microbiomes to understand host evolutionary histories at a supra-organismal level.",
