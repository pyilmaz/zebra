Each fish was classified as healthy or morbid by veterinarians upon visual inspection. Fish were sacrificed with an overdose of MS\u00ad222 (Finquel, Argent Laboratories), and examined for the presence of gross external and internal lesions to confirm preliminary diagnoses. Symptomatic fish had empty gut contents. Five symptomatic and five asymptomatic fish were selected and gut contents were collected by flushing aseptically with 10 mL of SM buffer. Samples were sonicated (15 seconds, 3 times) and then centrifuged at 150 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then filtered (0.45 &#956;m and 0.2 &#956;m) to separate the microbial fraction (attached onto the filter) from the viruses (filtrate). Viral particles in the filtrate were purified using a CsCl step gradient and viral DNA was extracted as described by Thurber . Viral DNA was amplified with GenomiPhi (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and ethanol precipitated. Approximately 10 &#956;g of each DNA sample was submitted for GS20 pyrosequencing at 454 Life Sciences to produce the FishHealGutKentSTVir20060504 and FishMorGutKentSTVir20060504 metagenomes (from healthy fish and morbid fish respectively). Duplicate sequences were removed and the metagenomes were submitted to NCBI (Genome Project 28397 and 28399).",

Symptomatic fish had empty gut contents. Five symptomatic and five asymptomatic fish were selected and gut contents were collected by flushing aseptically with 10 mL of SM buffer. Samples were sonicated (15 seconds, 3 times) and then centrifuged at 150 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then filtered (0.45 &#956;m and 0.2 &#956;m) to separate the microbial fraction (attached onto the filter) from the viruses (filtrate).

Symptomatic fish had empty gut contents. Five symptomatic and five asymptomatic fish were selected and gut contents were collected by flushing aseptically with 10 mL of SM buffer. Samples were sonicated (15 seconds, 3 times) and then centrifuged at 150 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C.
