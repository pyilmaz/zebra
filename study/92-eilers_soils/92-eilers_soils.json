            "study_abstract": "Low molecular weight carbon (C) substrates are major drivers of bacterial activity and diversity in the soil environment. However, it is not well understood how specific low molecular weight C compounds, which are frequently found in root exudates and litter leachates, influence bacterial community structure or if there are specific groups of soil bacteria that preferentially respond to these C inputs. To address these knowledge gaps, we added three simple C substrates representative of common root exudate compounds (glucose, glycine, and citric acid) to microcosms containing three distinct soils from a grassland, hardwood forest, and coniferous forest. CO2 production was assessed over a 24???h incubation period and, at the end of the incubation, DNA was extracted from the samples for assessment of bacterial community structure via bar-coded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. All three C substrates significantly increased CO2 production in all soils; however, there was no relationship between the magnitude of the increase in CO2 production and the shift in bacterial community composition. All three substrates had significant effects on overall community structure with the changes primarily driven by relative increases in _-Proteobacteria, _-Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Citric acid additions had a particularly strong influence on bacterial communities, producing a 2???5-fold increase in the relative abundance of the _-Proteobacteria subphylum. These results suggest that although community-level responses to substrate additions vary depending on the substrate and soil in question, there are specific bacterial taxa that preferentially respond to the substrate additions across soil",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA).

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls.

In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. We then amplified the 16S rRNA gene using a bar-coded primer set that is well suited for community analyses via pyrosequencing",

At each of the three locations, 20 soil cores (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm in depth) were collected from an area of 20 m2, composited together, sieved to 2 mm, and thoroughly homogenized. The soils were stored at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C for 23 days prior to the start of the experiment. The soils from the three different vegetation types (henceforth referred to as \u00c2\u0091grassland\u00c2\u0092, \u00c2\u0091hardwood forest\u00c2\u0092 and \u00c2\u0091coniferous forest\u00c2\u0092 soils) were distinct with respect to their organic C concentrations, percent total N, C:N ratios, and pH levels\r\n\r\nMicrocosms were prepared by adding 5 g (fresh weight) of grassland, hardwood, or coniferous forest soil to a 50 mL glass vial equipped with a gas-tight screw cap lid and septa. Microcosm soils were adjusted to 50% of water holding capacity (see Table 1), then capped and incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 days. Microcosms were then removed from the incubator, uncapped, and vented for approximately 10 min prior to substrate addition.\r\n\r\nEach microcosm received 500 &#956;L of a sterile glucose, glycine, or citric acid solution with each solution pH balanced to pH 7 (using NaOH and HCl) and adjusted to a standard carbon (C) concentration (200 mM C, or 240 &#956;g C g soil&#8722;1) which was determined to be optimal for maximizing soil respiration rates (data not shown). The control treatments received 500 &#956;l of sterile H2O alone. For each substrate and soil combination (3 LMW-C substrates, 3 soils), four replicated microcosms were used, resulting in a total of 48 microcosms including the no-substrate water controls. Microcosms were incubated at 27 \u00c2\u00b0C for 24 h with headspace CO2 accumulation measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (CA-10a, Sable Systems, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, USA). In all cases and all timepoints, headspace CO2 concentrations did not exceed 2%. At the end of the 24 h period, the soil from each microcosm was thoroughly homogenized and frozen at &#8722;80 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to DNA extraction.\r\n\r\nDNA was extracted from 0.25 g soil from each microcosm using a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.
