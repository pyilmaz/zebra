Briefly, eggs were flooded, allowed to hatch overnight and resultant larvae were provided ground fish food and reared in a walk-in incubator maintained at 26\u00c2\u00b0C. Pupae were removed and adults allowed to emerge into 3.8-liter cardboard cages with netting over the open end. Adult mosquitoes were transported to a Biological Safety Level-3 containment laboratory where they were inoculated intrathoracically with 0.3 uL of a DENV-1 (HAW strain) virus suspension containing 106.2 PFU/mL of inoculum (102.7 PFU/mosquito). Inoculated mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 26\u00c2\u00b0C for 7 days. Mosquitoes were then killed by freezing at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min and then triturated either individually or with the addition of uninfected Ae. aegypti in 0.6 mL of diluent (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in Medium 199 with Earle's salts [Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA] and antibiotics). A 0.1-mL aliquot of the mosquito suspension was removed and added to 0.9 mL of diluent. This was frozen at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until testing by plaque assay on Vero cells to determine the number of viral particles present in the sample. 1.5 mL of TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was then added to each tube and the contents of each vial were divided into two cryovials to create duplicate samples. TRIzol-LS extraction of total RNA from homogenized mosquitoes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 uL of RNase-free water and stored at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until use.",

Pupae were removed and adults allowed to emerge into 3.8-liter cardboard cages with netting over the open end. Adult mosquitoes were transported to a Biological Safety Level-3 containment laboratory where they were inoculated intrathoracically with 0.3 uL of a DENV-1 (HAW strain) virus suspension containing 106.2 PFU/mL of inoculum (102.7 PFU/mosquito). Inoculated mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 26\u00c2\u00b0C for 7 days. Mosquitoes were then killed by freezing at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min and then triturated either individually or with the addition of uninfected Ae. aegypti in 0.6 mL of diluent (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in Medium 199 with Earle's salts [Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA] and antibiotics). A 0.1-mL aliquot of the mosquito suspension was removed and added to 0.9 mL of diluent. This was frozen at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until testing by plaque assay on Vero cells to determine the number of viral particles present in the sample. 1.5 mL of TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was then added to each tube and the contents of each vial were divided into two cryovials to create duplicate samples. TRIzol-LS extraction of total RNA from homogenized mosquitoes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 uL of RNase-free water and stored at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until use.",

Pupae were removed and adults allowed to emerge into 3.8-liter cardboard cages with netting over the open end. Adult mosquitoes were transported to a Biological Safety Level-3 containment laboratory where they were inoculated intrathoracically with 0.3 uL of a DENV-1 (HAW strain) virus suspension containing 106.2 PFU/mL of inoculum (102.7 PFU/mosquito). Inoculated mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 26\u00c2\u00b0C for 7 days. Mosquitoes were then killed by freezing at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min and then triturated either individually or with the addition of uninfected Ae. aegypti in 0.6 mL of diluent (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in Medium 199 with Earle's salts [Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA] and antibiotics). A 0.1-mL aliquot of the mosquito suspension was removed and added to 0.9 mL of diluent. This was frozen at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until testing by plaque assay on Vero cells to determine the number of viral particles present in the sample. 1.5 mL of TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was then added to each tube and the contents of each vial were divided into two cryovials to create duplicate samples. TRIzol-LS extraction of total RNA from homogenized mosquitoes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 uL of RNase-free water and stored at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until use.",

Pupae were removed and adults allowed to emerge into 3.8-liter cardboard cages with netting over the open end. Adult mosquitoes were transported to a Biological Safety Level-3 containment laboratory where they were inoculated intrathoracically with 0.3 uL of a DENV-1 (HAW strain) virus suspension containing 106.2 PFU/mL of inoculum (102.7 PFU/mosquito). Inoculated mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 26\u00c2\u00b0C for 7 days. Mosquitoes were then killed by freezing at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min and then triturated either individually or with the addition of uninfected Ae. aegypti in 0.6 mL of diluent (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in Medium 199 with Earle's salts [Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA] and antibiotics). A 0.1-mL aliquot of the mosquito suspension was removed and added to 0.9 mL of diluent. This was frozen at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until testing by plaque assay on Vero cells to determine the number of viral particles present in the sample. 1.5 mL of TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was then added to each tube and the contents of each vial were divided into two cryovials to create duplicate samples. TRIzol-LS extraction of total RNA from homogenized mosquitoes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 uL of RNase-free water and stored at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until use.",

Pupae were removed and adults allowed to emerge into 3.8-liter cardboard cages with netting over the open end. Adult mosquitoes were transported to a Biological Safety Level-3 containment laboratory where they were inoculated intrathoracically with 0.3 uL of a DENV-1 (HAW strain) virus suspension containing 106.2 PFU/mL of inoculum (102.7 PFU/mosquito). Inoculated mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 26\u00c2\u00b0C for 7 days. Mosquitoes were then killed by freezing at &#8722;20\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min and then triturated either individually or with the addition of uninfected Ae. aegypti in 0.6 mL of diluent (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in Medium 199 with Earle's salts [Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA] and antibiotics). A 0.1-mL aliquot of the mosquito suspension was removed and added to 0.9 mL of diluent. This was frozen at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until testing by plaque assay on Vero cells to determine the number of viral particles present in the sample. 1.5 mL of TRIzol-LS (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was then added to each tube and the contents of each vial were divided into two cryovials to create duplicate samples. TRIzol-LS extraction of total RNA from homogenized mosquitoes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was resuspended in 50 uL of RNase-free water and stored at &#8722;70\u00c2\u00b0C until use.",
