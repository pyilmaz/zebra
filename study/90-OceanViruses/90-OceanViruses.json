            "project_description": "Phages affect microbial evolution by inserting themselves into genomes as prophages. Prophages often account for most of the difference between strains of the same microbial species [4], and they can dramatically change the phenotype of the hosts via lysogenic conversion. For example, many nonpathogens and pathogens only differ by prophages that encode exotoxin genes [5]. Phages also affect microbial evolution by moving genes from host to host. It has been hypothesized that most of the orphan open reading frames (ORFans) in microbial genomes are actually of phage origin [6]. Phages may also affect microbial evolution by killing specific microbes. Various Lotka-Volterra models, called \u0093kill-the-winner,\u0094 predict that as one microbial strain becomes dominant, its viral predator kills it and leaves open a niche that can be used by a related strain that is resistant to the phage [7,8]. This model may explain the enormous microdiversity observed in microbial communities [9].\r\nThe advent of whole-community genome sequencing (i.e., metagenomics) is rapidly changing the way viral and microbial diversity are assayed. Using this approach, it is possible to rapidly characterize the metabolic diversity and community structure of any microbial ecosystem [10\u009619]. We studied the marine viral metagenome (virome) of four oceanic regions. The viromes were obtained by pyrosequencing uncultured viral assemblages that were integrated over 4,600 km in distance, 3,000 m in depth, and over a decade in time in order to characterize them and identify patterns of viral distribution and diversity.\r\n\r\nSamples were collected from four oceanic regions. Briefly, the viral samples were concentrated on tangential flow filters (30\u0096100-kD cutoff), distributed into 50-ml tubes and stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. A single sample was collected from the Sargasso Sea (labeled SAR) on 30 June 2005. Chloroform was added to this sample to stop microbial growth. Integrative samples, representing multiple sites and times, were assembled from the Gulf of Mexico (labeled GOM; 13 sites; 42 individual samples), the British Columbia coastal waters (labeled BBC; 38 sites; 85 individual samples), and the Arctic Ocean (labeled Arctic; 16 sites; 56 individual samples). These samples represent the combined viral assemblages of four oceanic regions over approximately one decade.",
