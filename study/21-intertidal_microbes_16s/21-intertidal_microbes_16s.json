I thus have 48 collections for 16s analyses through the EMP at Argonne Labs (Gilbert Lab) designed to test whether microbial diversity increases in proximity to ammonium-excreting animals and whether the presence and absence of the abundant California mussel is a determinant of microbial diversity.  All samples come from the coast of Washington state in 2009 and 2010, including 2 locales:  Tatoosh Island and Second Beach.  Microbial populations of the rocky intertidal areas of the northeast Pacific are little described compared to their open ocean counterparts.  Thus, the work will be a novel investigation into diversity of this area as well as determinants of diversity.",
