Possibility of entrainment of ambient seawater was not ruled out. Eleven 16S rRNA gene clone libraries including 34 archaeal and 72 bacterial phylotypes were constructed from total 708 clones of hydrothermal vent prokaryotes trapped by 0.2- and 0.1-&#956;m-pore-size filters. Crenarchaeota and Proteobacteria phylotypes dominated the archaeal and bacterial populations, respectively. Novel unaffiliated phylotypes occurred only in the 0.1-&#956;m-trapped populations.",
