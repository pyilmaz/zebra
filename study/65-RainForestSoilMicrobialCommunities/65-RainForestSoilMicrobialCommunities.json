            "project_description": "Producing cellulosic biofuels from plant material\r\nhas recently emerged as a key US Department of Energy\r\ngoal. For this technology to be commercially viable on a\r\nlarge scale, it is critical to make production cost efficient by\r\nstreamlining both the deconstruction of lignocellulosic\r\nbiomass and fuel production. Many natural ecosystems\r\nefficiently degrade lignocellulosic biomass and harbor\r\nenzymes that, when identified, could be used to increase\r\nthe efficiency of commercial biomass deconstruction.\r\nHowever, ecosystems most likely to yield relevant\r\nenzymes, such as tropical rain forest soil in Puerto Rico,\r\nare often too complex for enzyme discovery using current\r\nmetagenomic sequencing technologies. One potential strategy\r\nto overcome this problem is to selectively cultivate the\r\nmicrobial communities from these complex ecosystems on\r\nbiomass under defined conditions, generating less complex\r\nbiomass-degrading microbial populations. To test this\r\npremise, we cultivated microbes from Puerto Rican soil or\r\ngreen waste compost under precisely defined conditions in the\r\npresence dried ground switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) or\r\nlignin, respectively, as the sole carbon source. Phylogenetic\r\nprofiling of the two feedstock-adapted communities using SSU rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing or phylogenetic\r\nmicroarray analysis revealed that the adapted communities\r\nwere significantly simplified compared to the natural\r\ncommunities from which they were derived. Several members\r\nof the lignin-adapted and switchgrass-adapted consortia\r\nare related to organisms previously characterized as biomass\r\ndegraders, while others were from less well-characterized\r\nphyla. The decrease in complexity of these communities\r\nmake them good candidates for metagenomic sequencing\r\nand will likely enable the reconstruction of a greater number\r\nof full-length genes, leading to the discovery of novel\r\nlignocellulose-degrading enzymes adapted to feedstocks\r\nand conditions of interest.",
