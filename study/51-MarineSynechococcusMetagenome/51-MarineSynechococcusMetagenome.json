Because they do not require culturing, metagenomic approaches have the potential to reveal the genetic diversity of the microbes actually present in an environment. From coastal California seawater, a complex and diverse environment, the marine cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus were enriched by flow cytometry-based sorting and the population metagenome was analysed with 454 sequencing technology. The sequence data were compared with model Synechococcus genomes, including those of two coastal strains, one isolated from the same and one from a very similar environment. ",

The sampled water was processed for chlorophyll, nutrient and flow cytometry analysis. Chlorophyll measurements were obtained from unfiltered seawater and seawater filtered through a 2.0 &#956;m polycarbonate filter (GE Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN). Five hundred millilitres were passed through GF/F filters (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C. Within 2 weeks, chlorophyll was extracted from the filters with 90% acetone in dark at &#8722;20\u00b0C overnight. Samples for flow cytometry were preserved with 0.25% gluteraldehyde and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C. The samples were analysed at the highest flow rate using a Becton-Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer as described by Collier and Palenik (2003), but without applying a compensation matrix.  A concentrated picoplankton sample was obtained for flow cytometry sorting as follows: Three litres were filtered through 2.0 &#956;m polycarbonate filters (GE Osmonics) to remove zooplankton and large phytoplankton. The < 2.0 &#956;m picoplankton, including Synechococcus, were captured onto 0.45 &#956;m Supor 200 filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and re-suspended by repetitively flushing the filters with 1 ml of seawater using a pipettor. In total, 8 ml of concentrated and re-suspended picoplankton was obtained.  Using flow cytometry, Synechococcus cells are distinguished from other picoplankton by the fluorescence of their phycoerythrin pigments. From the picoplankton concentrate, Synechococcus cells were sorted using a FACS Vantage DiVa instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The sorted cells were collected onto a 0.2 &#956;m Supor 200 filter (Pall) and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C.",
