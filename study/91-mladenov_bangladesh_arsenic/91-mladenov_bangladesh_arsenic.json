            "study_abstract": "Arsenic toxicity in drinking water is a global human health concern impacting tens of millions of people. The problem is especially acute in the Ganges- Meghna- Brahmaputra Delta (GMBD) region of Bangladesh where geogenic groundwater arsenic concentrations can be more than 10 times the World Health Organization???s limit. There is evidence that microorganisms facilitate groundwater arsenic mobilization in the GMBD through cascading reduction and oxidation reactions involving labile organic carbon, humic substances, iron and arsenic in the aquifer sediments. However, our preliminary sequence-based data suggest that cultured representatives that are known to mediate these redox reactions are not abundant in the GMBD groundwater environment. Thus, the goal of this research was to investigate patterns in bacterial community composition across geochemical gradients in a groundwater aquifer in Araihazar, Bangladesh to generate hypotheses about the types of organisms that may be involved in arsenic cycling. We characterized the bacterial community by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes from aquifer sediment samples collected three locations along the groundwater flowpath, at a range of depths between 5 and 50 meters. Our analysis of the 31,517 16S rRNA sequences indicated that bacterial communities at our study site are diverse; 11,564 OTU???s and 52 different bacterial divisions are represented in the dataset. Also, we performed a principal coordinates analysis and found that bacterial community structure is statistically significantly distinct at the different sampling sites, which correspond to different locations along the groundwater flowpath and thus groundwater arsenic concentrations. In addition, sediment carbon significantly structures bacterial communities at all sampling sites and depths. This research represents the first comprehensive characterization of the composition bacterial communities across geochemical gradients in the arsenic-rich GMBD groundwater environment.",
