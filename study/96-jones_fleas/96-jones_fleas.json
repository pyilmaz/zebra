            "project_description": "A common strategy of pathogenic bacteria is to form close associations with parasitic insects that feed on animals and to use these insects as vectors for their own transmission. Pathogens interact closely with other coexisting bacteria within the insect, and interactions between co-occurring bacteria may influence the vector competency of the parasite. Interactions between particular lineages can be explored through measures of _-diversity. Furthermore, general patterns of bacterial community assembly can be explored through measures of _-diversity. Here, we use pyrosequencing (n=115_924 16S rRNA gene sequences) to describe the bacterial communities of 230 prairie dog fleas sampled across space and time. We use these communinty characterizations to assess interactions between dominant community members and to explore general patterns of bacterial community assembly in fleas. An analysis of co-occurrence patterns suggests non-neutral negative interactions between dominant community members (P<0.001). Furthermore, bacterial communities of fleas shift dramatically across years (phylotype-based: R=0.829, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.612???0.753, P<0.001), but they also significantly differ across space (phylotype-based: R=0.418, P<0.001; phylogenetic-based: R=0.290???0.328, P<0.001) and between flea species (phylotype-based: R=0.160, P=0.011; phylogenetic-based: not significant). Collectively, our results show that flea-associated bacterial communities are not random assemblages; rather, an individual flea''s bacterial community is governed by interactions between bacterial lineages and by the flea''s place in space and time.",

Sampling dates were chosen to maximize the potential of capturing Oropsylla tuberculata cynomuris  (peak abundance in late winter and early spring), and dates differ between years due to variable weather conditions between years.\r\n\r\nCollected fleas were immediately placed in ethanol and stored at &#8722;20&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C until DNA extraction\r\n\r\nFleas were washed in a solution of 0.133&#8201;M NaCl, 1.11% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.0088&#8201;M  EDTA two times to remove as many bacteria from the external flea parts as possible. To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C.

To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C.

To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C.

To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C.

Sampling dates were chosen to maximize the potential of capturing Oropsylla tuberculata cynomuris  (peak abundance in late winter and early spring), and dates differ between years due to variable weather conditions between years.\r\n\r\nCollected fleas were immediately placed in ethanol and stored at &#8722;20&#8201;C until DNA extraction\r\n\r\nFleas were washed in a solution of 0.133&#8201;M NaCl, 1.11% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.0088&#8201;M  EDTA two times to remove as many bacteria from the external flea parts as possible. To maximize the removal of external bacteria, fleas were then subjected to a lysozyme (11.6&#8201;mg&#8201;l&#8722;1) treatment for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;C before being washed one final time. Cleaned fleas were crushed, and subjected to another lysozyme treatment of 30&#8201;min at 37 C. After this final lysozyme treatment, DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",
