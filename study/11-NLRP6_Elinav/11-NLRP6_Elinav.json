            "study_abstract": "Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that function as sensors of endogenous or exogenous damage-associated molecular patterns. Here we show that deficiency of NLRP6 in mouse colonic epithelial cells results in reduced IL-18 levels and an altered fecal microbiota characterized by expanded representation of members of Bacteroidetes (Prevotellaceae). Moreover, NLRP6 inflammasome-deficient mice were characterized by spontaneous intestinal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell recruitment, and exacerbation of chemical colitis induced by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Cross-fostering and co-housing experiments revealed that the colitogenic activity of this microbiota is transferable to neonatal or adult wild-type mice, leading to exacerbation of DSS colitis via induction of CCL5. Antibiotic treatment and electron microscopy studies further supported the role of Prevotellaceae as a key representative of this microbiota-associated phenotype. Altogether, perturbations in this inflammasome pathway, including NLRP6, ASC, Caspase-1 and IL-18 may constitute a predisposing or initiating event in some cases of human IBD. ",
