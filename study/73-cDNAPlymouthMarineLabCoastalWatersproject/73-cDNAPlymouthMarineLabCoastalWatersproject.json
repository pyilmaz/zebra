Eight samples, four DNA and four mRNA, were processed from two time points in a controlled coastal ocean mesocosm study (Bergen, Norway) involving an induced phytoplankton bloom producing a total of 323,161,989 base pairs. Our study confirms the finding of the first published metatranscriptomic studies of marine and soil environments that metatranscriptomics targets highly expressed sequences which are frequently novel. Our alternative methodology increases the range of experimental options available for conducting such studies and is characterized by an exceptional enrichment of mRNA (99.92%) versus ribosomal RNA. Analysis of corresponding metagenomes confirms much higher levels of assembly in the metatranscriptomic samples and a far higher yield of large gene families with >100 members, ~91% of which were novel.",

Each mesocosm contained 11,000 L of coastal water and two of the six mesocosms were sampled for this study. To induce the phytoplankton bloom, nitrate and phosphate were added. Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",

Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",

Each mesocosm contained 11,000 L of coastal water and two of the six mesocosms were sampled for this study. To induce the phytoplankton bloom, nitrate and phosphate were added. Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",

Each mesocosm contained 11,000 L of coastal water and two of the six mesocosms were sampled for this study. To induce the phytoplankton bloom, nitrate and phosphate were added. Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",

Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",

Each mesocosm contained 11,000 L of coastal water and two of the six mesocosms were sampled for this study. To induce the phytoplankton bloom, nitrate and phosphate were added. Water samples were taken at the peak and immediately following the collapse of the phytoplankton bloom from both a high CO2 and control mesocosm. The nucleic acid extraction methodologies are briefly outlined in Gilbert et al. but are fully described here. To isolate DNA and RNA, 15 L of water from each sample was filtered through a 140 mm diameter, 1.6 \u00b5m GF/A filter (Whatman), to reduce eukaryotic cell abundance and maximize the proportion of prokaryotic cells. This filtration took only 3 minutes and the filtrate was applied directly to a 0.22 \u00b5m Sterivex filter (Millipore) to allow rapid filtration of samples (<15 minutes per sample) to limited mRNA degradation. Following filtration, each Sterivex was pumped dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80\u00b0C until extraction.",
