            "project_description": "We characterized gut microbial communities in 31 monozygotic twin pairs, 23 dizygotic twin pairs and, where available, their mothers (n = 46) (Supplementary Tables 1\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00965). Monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins and parent\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0096offspring pairs provided an attractive model for assessing the impact of genotype and shared early environmental exposures on the gut microbiome. Moreover, genetically \u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0091identical\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092 monozygotic twin pairs gain weight in response to overfeeding in a more reproducible way than unrelated individuals and are more concordant for body mass index (BMI) than dizygotic twin pairs. To characterize the bacterial lineages present in the faecal microbiotas of these 154 individuals, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing, targeting the full-length gene with an ABI 3730xl capillary sequencer. Additionally, we performed multiplex pyrosequencing with a 454 FLX instrument to survey the gene\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0092s V2 variable region and its V6 hypervariable region. Additionally, we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA.",
