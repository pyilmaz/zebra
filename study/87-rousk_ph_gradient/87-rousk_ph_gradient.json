We hypothesized that bacterial communities would be more strongly influenced by pH than fungal communities. To determine the relative abundance of bacteria and fungi, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR), and to analyze the composition and diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities, we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. Both the relative abundance and diversity of bacteria were positively related to pH, the latter nearly doubling between pH 4 and 8. In contrast, the relative abundance of fungi was unaffected by pH and fungal diversity was only weakly related with pH. The composition of the bacterial communities was closely defined by soil pH; there was as much variability in bacterial community composition across the 180-m distance of this liming experiment as across soils collected from a wide range of biomes in North and South America, emphasizing the dominance of pH in structuring bacterial communities. The apparent direct influence of pH on bacterial community composition is probably due to the narrow pH ranges for optimal growth of bacteria. Fungal community composition was less strongly affected by pH, which is consistent with pure culture studies, demonstrating that fungi generally exhibit wider pH ranges for optimal growth.",

The gradient was sampled every 10 m between 0 and 40 m, then every 5 m between 40 and 120 m, and then every 10 m between 120 and 180 m of the gradient. The greater number of samples between 40 and 120 m was based on the faster pH changes found previously in that interval (1). The 27 resulting soil samples were sieved (<2.8 mm) in the laboratory, and water contents were determined (105\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0C, 24 h).\r\n\r\nThe soil samples were stored frozen until molecular analyses were performed in January 2009. The DNA was extracted from 0.5&#8201;g subsamples using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.",
