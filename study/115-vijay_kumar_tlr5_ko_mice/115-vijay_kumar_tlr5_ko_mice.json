TLR5-deficeint mice may exhibit symptoms of metabolic syndrome.  Transfer of the cecal microbiota from these mice to wildtype germfree recipients in sufficient and required to transfer the symptoms of the syndrome.  This project describes the difference in bacterial community composition and structure between a normal cecal microbiota and the cecal microbiota of the TLR5-deficient mice.  The importance of this study is that it wil help understand how a gut microbiota can confer a metabolic disease to an otherwise healthy host. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences have been deposited in the Short Read Archive.",
