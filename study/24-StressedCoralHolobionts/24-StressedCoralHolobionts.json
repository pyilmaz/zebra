            "project_description": "The coral holobiont is the community of metazoans, protists and microbes associated with scleractinian corals. Disruptions in these associations have been correlated with coral disease, but little is known about the series of events involved in the shift from mutualism to pathogenesis. To evaluate structural and functional changes in coral microbial communities, Porites compressa was exposed to four stressors: increased temperature, elevated nutrients, dissolved organic carbon loading and reduced pH. Microbial metagenomic samples were collected and pyrosequenced. Functional gene analysis demonstrated that stressors increased the abundance of microbial genes involved in virulence, stress resistance, sulfur and nitrogen metabolism, motility and chemotaxis, fatty acid and lipid utilization, and secondary metabolism. Relative changes in taxonomy also demonstrated that coral-associated microbiota (Archaea, Bacteria, protists) shifted from a healthy-associated coral community (e.g. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and the zooxanthellae Symbiodinium) to a community (e.g. Bacteriodetes, Fusobacteria and Fungi) of microbes often found on diseased corals. Additionally, low-abundance Vibrio spp. were found to significantly alter microbiome metabolism, suggesting that the contribution of a just a few members of a community can profoundly shift the health status of the coral holobiont.",

Three apparently healthy coral heads of approximately 20 cm in diameter were removed with hammer and chisel at the base of the colony to avoid polyp damage. Specimens were placed in a 3 l seawater-cured bucket, carried to shore, and immediately transferred to open outdoor aquaria that contained continuous flowing seawater.Coral heads were broken into five fingers of equal size, &#8764;30-40 g. Each finger was sampled prior to placement in the tanks (Time Zero samples). Each coral finger was then placed in different glass aquaria (12.5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 8 inches), containing 5 l of treatment water. At each time point (1, 4, 16 and 64 h) all three fingers were sequentially removed from the tank, placed on sterile autoclaved aluminium foil, and 1-2 g of samples or 'nubbins' were cut away with a sterile razor blade. Nubbins were vigorously rinsed with filtered autoclaved seawater (FASW), placed in 15 ml tubes containing 10 ml of RNALater (Ambion; Foster City, CA) and stored at &#8722;20\u00b0C.",
