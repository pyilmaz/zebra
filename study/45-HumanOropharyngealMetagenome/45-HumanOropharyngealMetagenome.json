Viral DNA was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. Viral communities consisted almost exclu- sively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including Escherichia coli phage T3, Propionibacterium acnes phage PA6, and Streptococcus mitis phage SM1.",

Half of the pooled sample was filtered with a 0.22-&#956;m Millex-HV filter to remove cellular material. DNase I was added to the sample to a final concentration of 10 &#956;g\u00b7mL&#8722;1, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to degrade free DNA. The other half of the pooled sample was treated with chloroform but not filtered. Twenty microliters of chlorofrom was added per milliliter of viral concentrate, and the sample was then incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h and centrifuged at 2155 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant containing the viral concentrate was col- lected and treated with DNase I as described above. DNA was extracted from the filtered and chloroformed samples using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/formamide protocol",
