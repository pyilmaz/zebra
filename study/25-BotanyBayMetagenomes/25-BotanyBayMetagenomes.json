            "project_description": "The sponge Cymbastela concentrica is an abundant marine sponge found in shallow waters along the Australian east coast and has been previously studied with respect to its bacterial community composition (Taylor et al., 2004b, 2005). Fingerprinting analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene of temporal and spatial replicate samples for this sponge showed a stable bacterial community profile, which was distinct from that of the surrounding water, and showed specific phylotypes shared with the bacterial communities of other sponges. Hence, Cymbastela concentrica represents a model system for sponge\u0096bacteria interaction. In this study, we report a comparative metagenomic analysis of the specimens that leads to the discovery of novel, previously unrecognized functional properties of sponge bacteria. Water samples and sponge specimen were collected from Botany Bay near Bare Island, Sydney, Australia (S 33.59.461; E 151.13.946) on 18 October 2006 between 10.47 am and 1.15 pm (T1).",
