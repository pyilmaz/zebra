There has not been a global survey of these viruses, and consequently, it is not known what types of viruses are in Earth's oceans or how they are distributed. Metagenomic analyses of 184 viral assemblages collected over a decade and representing 68 sites in four major oceanic regions showed that most of the viral sequences were not similar to those in the current databases. There was a distinct \"marine-ness\" quality to the viral assemblages. Global diversity was very high, presumably several hundred thousand of species, and regional richness varied on a North-South latitudinal gradient. The marine regions had different assemblages of viruses. Cyanophages and a newly discovered clade of single-stranded DNA phages dominated the Sargasso Sea sample, whereas prophage-like sequences were most common in the Arctic. However most viral species were found to be widespread. With a majority of shared species between oceanic regions, most of the differences between viral assemblages seemed to be explained by variation in the occurrence of the most common viral species and not by exclusion of different viral genomes.

Water from 80 m was retrieved via the R.V. Weatherbird II's CTD rosette equipped with 12 liter Niskin bottles. This depth was targeted because summer subsurface maximum in viral like particles (VLP) is historically located between 80 and 100 m. Upon recovery of CTD, seawater was transferred to a precleaned 150 L polypropylene carboy via acid washed silicone tubing. Viruses were concentrated using a Pelicon II tangential flow filtration system (Millipore Corporation; Bedford, MA) equipped with a 30 kd Biomax cassette filter (0.5 m2; modified polyethersulfone). Prior to collection the filter was cleaned with 0.1 N H3P04 recirculated for 45 minutes followed by 0.1N NaOH recirculated for 45 minutes. One-hundred and fifty liters of seawater was recirculated over the 30 kD filter until the retentate volume was ~150 ml. This concentration step took ~3 hours to complete. The final concentrate was distributed into four 45 ml aliquots in sterile Falcon tubes. Five ml of chloroform was added to each tube, stored and shipped at 4\u00b0 C until arrival at SDSU.",
