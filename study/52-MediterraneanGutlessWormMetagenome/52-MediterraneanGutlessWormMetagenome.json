            "project_description": "How does the symbiosis compensate for the loss of digestive and excretory systems in the host, what do the various partners gain from this relationship, and is it mutually obligate? What is the selective advantage for O. algarvensis in harbouring multiple symbiotic partners? Our metagenomic analyses explain how the bacterial consortium meets the energy and waste management needs of its oligochaete host. We describe how resource partitioning between the phylogenetically diverse symbionts benefits both the symbionts and the worm in the heterogeneous environment. Finally, we propose a model showing that the selective advantage of harbouring multiple symbionts lies in their ability to supply their host with energy from an abundant and diverse supply of reducing equivalents and electron acceptors as it shuttles between the oxidized and reduced sediment layers.",
